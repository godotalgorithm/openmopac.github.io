There are three available support channels for MOPAC: the [openmopac@gmail.com](mailto:openmopac@gmail.com) email address and
the [Issues](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/discussions) sections of MOPAC's GitHub repository.
The email address is for private inquiries, and GitHub is for public inquiries.
Public inquiries are preferred, but they require a GitHub account (which are free to create).

The [Discussions](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/discussions) section is for help with installing or using MOPAC, or for
further clarification about its features or domain of applicability beyond the information available on this website.
While most questions will be answered by MOPAC's maintainer, this also gives other MOPAC users a chance to contribute to support.
An open support process naturally accumulates a list of frequently asked questions to improve the efficiency of the support process.
You should check the Discussions before making a support request to see if your question has been answered before.

The [Issues](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/issues) section is for bug reports and feature requests. When reporting a bug
as an Issue or over email, please provide an example input file or API call that produces the bug.
