As an open-source project, MOPAC is open to contributions of a variety of forms. Prior notice is not required for contributions,
but it may be worthwhile to discuss possible contributions as a GitHub [Issue](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/issues)
or [Discussion](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/discussions) or [by email](mailto:openmopac@gmail.com).

Developers interested in contributing to MOPAC's source code should read the
[guidelines for contribution](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst).
Note that the majority of the code base is written in Fortran 90, with small amounts of
C, Python, CMake, and Javascript. Welcome software contributions include new features, performance optimization,
and expanded test coverage. Reorganization or refactoring of the code base is also welcome, but such contributions
may be more challenging and slow to accept.

If you rely on MOPAC for some regular workflow, then you should consider contributing tests that are representative of that workflow.
This will greatly reduce the chance that future MOPAC development will interfere with your workflow and allow you to benefit from
future versions with less worry. Some tests may be used for future performance optimization, so contributing tests increases the chances
that your MOPAC-based workflow will be made more efficient in the future.

The manual on this website has been retained from the old Stewart Computational Chemistry website, which is raw HTML that was developed
using Microsoft Frontpage. It would be beneficial to migrate more of that content into Hugo (e.g. it could be indexed by Hugo's search functionality),
but that would be a lot of work and is only viable as a community effort. Such web development contributions are very welcome
and don't require knowledge of Fortran or the nuances of MOPAC's code base.

While MOPAC is not presently set up to accept financial contributions, such contributions in the form of donations or contract work
are tentatively welcome. This would likely require the creation of a project account or partnership with a fiscal sponsor.
